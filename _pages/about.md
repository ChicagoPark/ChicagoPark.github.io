I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [WashU](https://cigroup.wustl.edu/), fortunately working with [Prof. Ulugbek S. Kamilov](https://ukmlv.github.io/). I was a prior research intern at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/) in 2024 summer. I graduated summa cum laude with a B.S. degree at [WashU](https://cigroup.wustl.edu/).
